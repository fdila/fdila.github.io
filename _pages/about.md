I like building stuff!
I'm passionate about robotics, embedded programming, electronics.

In my free time I also like making music and doing calisthenics.

## Experience

### Junior Research Assistant - Università di Milano Bicocca (2020 - present)

I'm currently working in the robotics lab of my University: [https://ira.disco.unimib.it/](https://ira.disco.unimib.it/)

We are working on a self driving golf cart.

I have worked both on the hardware/firmware and on the high-level software, using the framework ROS.

### Tutor for the course "Computer Architecture" - Università di Milano Bicocca (2020 - present)

I'm a tutor for the Computer Architecture course.

I also built a MIPS simulator in logisim-evolution for the course laboratories, it can be found [here](https://github.com/fdila/MIPS-multicycle-datapath)

## Education

### Master's degree - Università di Milano Bicocca (2020 - present)
Currently studying for my Computer Science Master's degree.

Cool courses I followed:
- Electronics Experimentations: building an acquisition chain for SiPM sensors, building the analog circuit acquiring the data through an MCU ADC.
- Industrial Informatics: digital circuit design and FPGA programming
- Probabilistic Models: Bayesian networks, Markov Chains, Hidden Markov Models

You can find some of the projects I made [here](https://github.com/fdila/computer-science#master)

### Bachelor's degree - Università di Milano Bicocca (2018 - 2020)
Computer Science Bachelor's degree, final marks 106/110.

You can find my thesis [here](https://github.com/fdila/bachelor-thesis)
